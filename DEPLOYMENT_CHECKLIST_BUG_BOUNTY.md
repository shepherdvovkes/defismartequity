## üöÄ STEP 1: SMART CONTRACT DEPLOYMENT

### **1.1 Environment Setup**
```bash
# Clone repository and install dependencies
git clone <repository-url>
cd defismart
npm install

# Verify Hardhat configuration
cat hardhat.config.js
```

### **1.2 Deploy Secure Contract**
```bash
# Deploy the fixed contract
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-secure.js --network sepolia

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ DefimonToken deployed to: <ADDRESS>
# ‚úÖ DefimonInvestment (SECURE) deployed to: <ADDRESS>
# ‚úÖ Tokens transferred to investment contract
# ‚úÖ Emergency pause successful
# ‚úÖ Emergency resume successful
```

### **1.3 Verify Deployment**
```bash
# Verify contract on Sepolia
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <CONTRACT_ADDRESS>

# Check contract addresses
npx hardhat console --network sepolia
> const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("DefimonInvestment", "<ADDRESS>")
> await contract.defimonToken()
> await contract.signer1()
> await contract.signer2()
> await contract.signer3()
```

### **1.4 Security Feature Verification**
```bash
# Test emergency controls
npx hardhat console --network sepolia
> const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("DefimonInvestment", "<ADDRESS>")
> await contract.emergencyPause()
> await contract.paused() // Should return true
> await contract.emergencyResume()
> await contract.paused() // Should return false

# Check investment limits
> await contract.MIN_INVESTMENT_INTERVAL() // Should return 60 (1 minute)
> await contract.MAX_TOTAL_INVESTMENT() // Should return 1000000000000000000000 (1000 ETH)
```

---

## üöÄ STEP 2: FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT

### **2.1 Environment Setup**
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Verify environment configuration
cat .env.example
```

### **2.2 Build and Deploy**
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run start

# Expected output:
# ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000
```

### **2.3 Frontend Security Verification**
- [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- [ ] Verify redirect to authentication page
- [ ] Test wallet connection flow
- [ ] Verify authentication challenge signing
- [ ] Test protected route access

---

## üîç STEP 3: SECURITY TESTING

### **3.1 Reentrancy Attack Testing**

#### **Test 1: Basic Investment Function**
```bash
# Test normal investment flow
npx hardhat console --network sepolia
> const contract = await ethers.getContractAt("DefimonInvestment", "<ADDRESS>")
> const [signer] = await ethers.getSigners()
> await contract.invest({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01") })
```

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Investment successful, tokens transferred

#### **Test 2: Reentrancy Attack Simulation**
```bash
# Deploy malicious contract (if available)
# Attempt reentrancy attack
# Expected Result: ‚ùå Attack should fail, no reentrancy possible
```

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Reentrancy attack blocked, funds protected

### **3.2 Authentication Bypass Testing**

#### **Test 1: Direct API Access**
```bash
# Test unauthenticated API access
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/contracts
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/investments
```

**Expected Result**: ‚ùå 401 Unauthorized - Authentication required

#### **Test 2: Protected Route Access**
- Navigate directly to `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`
- Expected Result: ‚ùå Redirect to authentication page

#### **Test 3: Authenticated Access**
- Connect wallet and sign authentication challenge
- Navigate to dashboard
- Expected Result: ‚úÖ Access granted with proper authentication

---

## üõ°Ô∏è STEP 4: SECURITY FEATURE TESTING

### **4.1 Rate Limiting**
```bash
# Test rapid successive requests
# Expected Result: ‚ùå Rate limit exceeded after threshold
```

### **4.2 Investment Limits**
```bash
# Test minimum investment
> await contract.invest({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.0005") })
# Expected Result: ‚ùå "Minimum investment is 0.001 ETH"

# Test maximum investment
> await contract.invest({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("150") })
# Expected Result: ‚ùå "Maximum investment is 100 ETH"
```

### **4.3 Emergency Controls**
```bash
# Test emergency pause (as emergency controller)
> await contract.emergencyPause()
> await contract.paused() // Should return true

# Test investment during emergency
> await contract.invest({ value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01") })
# Expected Result: ‚ùå "Contract is in emergency mode"
```

- **After Fix**: State updates before external calls (SECURE)
- **Verification**: Attempt reentrancy attack - should fail

### **2. Authentication Flow**
- **Before Fix**: Client-side only, easily bypassed
- **After Fix**: Server-side cryptographic verification
- **Verification**: Direct API access should return 401

### **3. Emergency Controls**
- **Before Fix**: Limited emergency response capability
- **After Fix**: Immediate pause/resume with dedicated controller
- **Verification**: Emergency functions should work as expected
