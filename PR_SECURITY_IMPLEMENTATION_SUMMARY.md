## üîß Technical Implementation

### Security Stack Architecture
```
withFullSecurity() ‚Üí withRateLimit() ‚Üí withAuth() ‚Üí API Handler
```

## üö® Breaking Changes

### API Authentication
- **Before**: Some endpoints had no authentication
- **After**: All endpoints require Ethereum signature authentication
- **Impact**: Users must sign messages for API access

### CORS Restrictions
- **Before**: Potentially permissive CORS
- **After**: Restricted to trusted origins only
- **Impact**: Cross-origin requests limited to approved domains

### Rate Limiting
- **Before**: No rate limiting on most endpoints
- **After**: All endpoints have configurable rate limits
- **Impact**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks

## üìà Benefits

### Security Improvements
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Same-origin policies and CORS restrictions
- **Clickjacking Protection**: Frame options and embedder policies
- **SQL Injection**: Input validation and pattern removal
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks

### Performance Impact
- **Minimal Overhead**: Optimized security implementation
- **Efficient Validation**: Lightweight input sanitization
- **Header Caching**: Security headers cached at Next.js level

### Compliance
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Follows security best practices
- **Industry Standards**: Meets enterprise security requirements
- **Audit Ready**: Comprehensive security documentation
